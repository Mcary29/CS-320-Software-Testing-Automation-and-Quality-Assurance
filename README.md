**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
To ensure that my code is functional, I follow a rigorous process of writing unit tests for each method and class. By utilizing automated testing frameworks such as JUnit, I can verify that each component of the program behaves as expected under various scenarios. Additionally, I employ continuous integration techniques to automate the testing process whenever changes are made to the codebase. In terms of security, I apply best practices such as input validation, proper error handling, and secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities and prevent malicious attacks.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Understanding user needs is an iterative process that involves gathering requirements, analyzing use cases, and translating them into technical specifications. I make it a priority to focus on the end-user experience while also considering the technical feasibility of solutions. For example, in the Contact Service project, I worked to ensure that the program met functional requirements like unique contact IDs, while also keeping the interface simple and intuitive. User feedback and regular updates to the project help in refining the program to better serve its intended purpose.

**How do I approach designing software?**
When designing software, I begin by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable components. I apply principles like SOLID design and use object-oriented programming to create modular, reusable code. My focus is on ensuring scalability, maintainability, and efficiency from the beginning. I often start with a blueprint of how the softwareâ€™s core functionalities should work and then iteratively build upon that foundation. Testing is integrated early in the development process to ensure that each component functions correctly before combining them into a complete system.
